```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Course Project Requirement

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. 

```{r time}
Sys.time()
Sys.Date()
```

## Mapping

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>%
addTiles()
df <- data.frame(lat = runif(500, min = 39.25, max = 39.35),
lng = runif(500, min = -76.65, max = -76.55))
df %>%
leaflet() %>%
addTiles() %>%
addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```

## Conclusion

As a Hopkins Student, I would like to draw Baltimore map.
